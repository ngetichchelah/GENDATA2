# "How do KCSE examination participation rates vary by gender, age group, and county in Kenya, and what trends emerge over time?"

### Why this is substantial:
1.	KCSE candidature is a strong proxy for educational success - Students who sit for KCSE represent those who've successfully navigated the entire secondary education system
2.	Regional equity analysis - Your county-level data can reveal educational inequalities between different regions of Kenya
3.	Gender parity insights - You can analyze whether gender gaps in education completion vary geographically
4.	Age pattern analysis - Over-age candidates might indicate systemic issues like grade repetition, late school entry, or interrupted schooling
5.	Policy relevance - This data directly informs education planning and resource allocation decisions
   
### Research addresses questions like:

•	Which counties are underperforming in getting students to KCSE level?
•	Are there regional patterns in gender disparities?
•	How do age distributions vary across counties?
•	What trends are emerging over the 2020-2024 period?
